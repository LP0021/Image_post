Post processing automation for image stack

This repository aims to make open source code purposed for image post processing

The objective is to facilitate easy batch transforms for multiple photos.

The concept initially came about as a need to pre-process image stacks in night photography ahead of either use in a stacking software for astrophotography, or in videography software.

There are small adjustments that are not easy to implement automatically.

Sunrise and Sunset image stacks include shutter speed adjustments that cause color imbalance and brightness gradients difficult to rectify.

The goal could be include the following features such as 
saturation adjustmennts
metadata reads to adjust based on image settings
proximity checks to ensure images either side in the stack match the gradient
stack spacing to bring an equal speed to a video transform by spacing frequency of sequenced images 
Merge images to fill differences 
beyond scope out of focus detection
